Library for quickly importing and exporting spreadsheet data. Data can be loaded
from and converted from / to an array, an Excel/CSV file or Spreadsheet object.

The main advantage of this library is the small amount of code needed to perform
an import or export of data, given one of the above formats.

## Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the library.

``` bash
$ composer require endroid/simple-spreadsheet
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Endroid\SimpleSpreadsheet\Adapter\FileAdapter;
use Endroid\SimpleSpreadsheet\SimpleSpreadsheet;

$spreadsheet = new SimpleSpreadsheet();
$spreadsheet->load('data.xlsx'); // Load all sheets from data.xlsx
$spreadsheet->load([
    'Players' => [
        ['name' => 'L. Messi', 'club' => 'Barcelona'],
        ['name' => 'C. Ronaldo', 'club' => 'Real Madrid']
    ]
]);

$spreadsheet->save(FileAdapter::class, ['Players'], ['filename' => 'players.csv']);
```

You can also use the `saveToString` and `getHeadersByFilename` methods to build a
Response object instead of directly outputting to the browser.
